1. Identify and extract only the section containing flight listings from the image.
2. Remove any irrelevant content like headers, footers, navigation, etc.
3. Return the flight options as a list of JSON objects with the following fields:
   - "airline"
   - "departure_time"
   - "arrival_time"
   - "price"
   - "stops"
   - "duration"
   - "departure_airport"
   - "arrival_airport"

## Steps
1. Use image processing techniques to identify and extract only the section containing flight listings from the image. Ignore any content that is not relevant to the flight listings.
